# Undercover Poker Engine

This project is in early development.

## About the submodules of the repository

If you only use *Node.js* to execute the code, you dont need to retrieve any of the submodules since the best way to do it properly is to use *npm*. The submodules are needed for code running into a browser.

## How to run the tests

### With Node.js

Execute the following commands into your terminal:

```bash
	npm install jasmine-node requirejs
	node test/run-test-node.js
```
